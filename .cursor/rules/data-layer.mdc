# Data Layer

All portfolio content lives in `src/data/` as typed TypeScript files. No CMS or database.

## File Convention

Each data file exports:
1. A TypeScript **interface** for the data shape
2. A **const array** (or object) of the data

```ts
export interface Experience {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  company: string;
  period: string;
  description: string;
  technologies: string[];
}

export const experiences: Experience[] = [ ... ];
```

## Current Data Files

| File | Exports | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `experience.ts` | `Experience`, `experiences` | Career history, most recent first |
| `projects.ts` | `Project`, `projects` | Portfolio projects with links |
| `education.ts` | `Education`, `Coursework`, `education`, `coursework` | Degree + notable courses |
| `social.ts` | `SocialLink`, `socialLinks` | Social media/contact links |

## Rules

- Every item must have a unique `id` field (kebab-case string)
- Arrays are ordered by recency (newest first)
- `technologies` arrays contain 2-4 items (displayed as tags)
- Descriptions should be 1-2 sentences, under 160 characters
- URLs default to `"https://github.com"` or `"https://example.com"` as placeholders
- Icon types in `social.ts` must match the `iconMap` keys in `footer.tsx` and `contact.tsx`: `"github" | "linkedin" | "twitter" | "mail"`
